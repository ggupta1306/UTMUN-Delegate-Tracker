# Troubleshooting "Not Found" Error

## Possible Issues:

### 1. Frontend Static Site Not Created Yet
- Did you create the Static Site on Render?
- Go to Render dashboard → Click "New" → "Static Site"
- If you haven't created it yet, follow the steps in `FRONTEND_DEPLOY.md`

### 2. Frontend Still Building
- Check your Static Site status
- Look for yellow "Building" or green "Live"
- Wait for it to finish (3-5 minutes)

### 3. Wrong URL
- Click on the Static Site
- Copy the URL from the top
- It should be something like: `https://utmun-delegate-tracker-frontend.onrender.com`

### 4. Backend Not Running
- Check if your backend is "Running"
- The backend must be running for the frontend to work

## Quick Check List:
- [ ] Backend service exists and is "Running"
- [ ] Frontend Static Site exists and is "Live"
- [ ] Environment variable VITE_API_URL is set
- [ ] Using the correct frontend URL (not backend)

Tell me which step you're at!
